# Welcome to "fund_manager"!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]
A Java app that processes input fund managers and stock trades, then generates a summary tax report.

## [ BACKGROUND ]
This project was part of the Data Structures course work and provided exposure to dealing with input files, applying business logic, and generating output files accordingly.

## [ STACK ]
- Java

## [ LESSONS LEARNED ]
Fund_manager proved to be a great way to learn about creating domain classes in Java (e.g. StockTrade, FundManager) and service classes (e.g. FundManagerLogImpl, PrintImpl).  Separating these portions of the code from one another will help me to think in a more "modular" way moving forward, which should improve the organization, readability, and overall performance of my code.
